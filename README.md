# metab_proc_err
Code for adding autocorrelated and light varying process error to river metabolism models.

First get data together using script "Example data"

Script "compare_streamMetabolizer" makes sure that my homegrown Stan models return something close 
to stream metabolizer. It won't be exact.  I also compare process error with process and obs error models
